# Steps on Creating a GitHub Page
1. Create or clone a repository.
2. Create a .html file and name it "index.html"
3. Write some HTML code and construct your website. You may also use a stylesheet.
4. Commit changes and push it into your remote repository. Make sure
that all your resources (images, fonts, stylesheet) are also in your
remote repository.
5. Click on the settings tab of your GitHub repository. 
6. Click "Pages". 
7. Under "Build and deployment" and "Source, make sure that "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
8. Under "Build and deployment" and "Branch", select the main branch.
9. Click "Save"
10. Your GitHub page can now be viewed in the URL \<domain>/\<repository-name>. You can see the domain under "Custom domain" (the one ending in .github.io)

 The URL will also be shown at the top of the page along with the message "Your site is live at...". It may take a while for it to appear and you might need to refresh. 

# Key Takeaways
Being a web developer requires a lot of patience and persistence to
solve problems that may arise in creating a webpage, especially since
there are many elements involved. 

There may be unexpected errors that require attention to detail to resolve. Sometimes, your mistake is just mispelling a filename!

It is important to use version control to track changes and revert to previous functional versions in case of errors.
